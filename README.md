These are some of my projects in Machine Learning:

   Ensemble Methods

 Random Forest and XGBoost model on breast cancer dataset


   

Regression and Regularization

   Estimating obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions of an individual.


   

Spectral Clustering

   Spectral Clustering is a type of clustering algorithm in machine learning that <b>uses eigenvectors of a similarity matrix to divide a set of data points into clusters.
    The basic idea behind spectral clustering is to use the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of a graph to represent the data points and find clusters by applying k-means or      another clustering algorithm to the eigenvectors. 

    

SVM

   SVM classification for liver disease.
